The ambiguity of the sculpture inspires contemplation—and sometimes even interaction. As Lin has said of her work: “I consider the monuments to be true hybrids, existing between art and architecture. They have a specific need or function, yet their function is purely symbolic. Although the Women’s Table was commissioned in 1989 by President Benno Schmidt (BA 1963, JD 1966) for the 20th anniversary of the coeducation of Yale College, Lin chose to mark the presence—and absence—of registered female students since the inception of Yale in 1701. The spiraling numbers have prompted the proliferation of some misconceptions about women at Yale. For example, many people believe that 1873, the earliest date without a zero, marks the founding of the Yale School of Nursing—which actually opened fifty years later. When the initial research was done for the sculpture, 1873 was thought to mark the date of the first women students at the School of the Fine Arts. We now know, however, that the Silliman sisters registered for that school when it opened in 1869. And, although many people believe the numbers end when women finally outnumbered men, a simpler explanation is correct: the numbers end in 1993 when the sculpture was completed. Indeed, as of 1999, the total number of women enrolled at Yale had never exceeded the total number of men."},
