The ambiguity of the sculpture inspires contemplation—and sometimes even interaction. As Lin has said of her work: “I consider the monuments to be true hybrids, existing between art and architecture. They have a specific need or function, yet their function is purely symbolic. Although the Women’s Table was commissioned in 1989 by President Benno Schmidt (BA 1963, JD 1966) for the 20th anniversary of the coeducation of Yale College, Lin chose to mark the presence—and absence—of registered female students since the inception of Yale in 1701. The spiraling numbers have prompted the proliferation of some misconceptions about women at Yale. For example, many people believe that 1873, the earliest date without a zero, marks the founding of the Yale School of Nursing—which actually opened fifty years later. When the initial research was done for the sculpture, 1873 was thought to mark the date of the first women students at the School of the Fine Arts. We now know, however, that the Silliman sisters registered for that school when it opened in 1869. And, although many people believe the numbers end when women finally outnumbered men, a simpler explanation is correct: the numbers end in 1993 when the sculpture was completed. Indeed, as of 1999, the total number of women enrolled at Yale had never exceeded the total number of men."},

The focal point is a pair of hands holding a paper crane, a reference to the ancient Japanese legend promising eternal happiness to anyone who folds 1,000 such origami models. Her mural is the latest piece in President Joseph E. Aoun’s Public Art Initiative, which provides a platform for artists to brighten the campus with their creativity."},

The piece, by Boston artist Stephanie Cardon, aims to highlight the urgency of the global climate crisis. It achieves this in part by being extremely hard to ignore: the 3,400-square-foot orange tapestry, which hangs in the entrance to the Prudential Center, is a highlighter shade of orange. Woven into the netting is the text of Pope Francis’ 2015 Encyclical letter, “Laudato Si’: On Care for Our Common Home” advocating for global action on climate change. Made entirely out of recycled construction materials with the help of five MassArt students who were displaced from their homes during the Caribbean’s devastating 2017 hurricane season, “Unless” points to the human cost of global warming."},
